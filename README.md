Part 1: Software Engineering

1. What It Is & Why It Matters
Software engineering is all about designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software in a structured way. It keeps things scalable, reliable, and efficient—making it essential in industries like healthcare, finance, and tech.


2. Big Moments in Software Engineering

1968 NATO Conference: The term software engineering was born to tackle the "software crisis."

OOP Revolution (1970s-80s): Object-oriented programming (e.g., C++, Java) made code more modular and reusable.

Agile Manifesto (2001): Shifted focus to flexibility and collaboration over rigid planning.



3. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Requirements – Understanding what’s needed.

Design – Planning the system’s architecture.

Implementation – Writing the actual code.

Testing – Ensuring everything works.

Deployment – Releasing the product.

Maintenance – Fixing and updating over time.



4. Waterfall vs. Agile: Choosing the Right Approach

Waterfall – Step-by-step, structured, best for projects with fixed requirements (e.g., government contracts).

Agile – Fast, flexible, and iterative, great for startups or dynamic projects.



5. Who’s Involved?

Developers – Build features and write code.

QA Engineers – Hunt for and fix bugs.

Project Managers – Keep everything on track.



6. Essential Tools

IDEs (e.g., VS Code) – Help with coding and debugging.

Version Control (e.g., Git) – Tracks changes and makes teamwork easier.



7. Common Challenges & How to Tackle Them

Frequent requirement changes? → Use Agile sprints.

Accumulating technical debt? → Refactor regularly.

Poor communication? → Daily standups help.



8. Types of Testing (Why It’s a Big Deal)

Unit Testing – Checks small parts of the code.

Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.

System Testing – Tests the entire system as a whole.

Acceptance Testing – Confirms it meets user needs.

Part 2: AI & Prompt Engineering

1. What is Prompt Engineering?
It’s the art of crafting clear and precise inputs to guide AI responses. Better prompts lead to better results—critical for tools like ChatGPT.


2. How to Write a Good Prompt

Vague: "Write about dogs."

Better: "List three key differences between Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds in bullet points."

Why? Being specific makes the AI more focused, ensuring concise and useful responses.
